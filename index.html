                        <p style="font-size: 25px;">According to the World Health Organization, mental health is a state
                            of mental well-being that allows individuals to cope with life's challenges, realise their
                            strengths, study and work productively, and contribute to their community.<br>
                            It is an essential component of health and well-being that underlies our individual and
                            collective abilities to make decisions, form connections, and influence the environment in
                            which we live.<br>
                            Mental health is a fundamental human right.
                            And it's essential for personal, societal, and socio-economic growth.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Mental health exists on a complicated spectrum that varies from person to person, with
                            variable degrees of difficulty and discomfort and potentially very diverse social and

                            According to the American Psychiatric association, mental illnesses are health conditions
                            characterised by changes in emotion, thinking, or behaviour (or a combination of these).
                            Distress and/or difficulties functioning in social, workplace, or family activities are
                            associated with mental illnesses <a href="#Refrences">[2]</a>.
                            It causes individual distress and makes it difficult for them to function.
                            Mental illnesses complicate mental health by influencing how a person feels, thinks,
                            behaves, and experiences the world. It can be caused by genetics, brain chemistry, or
                            trauma <a href="#Refrences">[3]</a>.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Mental illness does not discriminate; it may affect anybody, regardless of age, gender,
                            geographic location, income, social position, race/ethnicity, religion/spirituality, sexual
                            orientation, background, or other component of cultural identification. While mental illness
                            can
                            strike at any age, three-quarters of all cases begin before the age of 24 <a href="#Refrences">[3]</a>.

                            For example, depression might impair your ability to communicate adequately, which can be

                            Someone suffering from anxiety or depression may have paranoia, which means that even
                            helpful criticism may be taken personally
                            and cause them to doubt themselves and their skills in the future. As a result, the worker

                            People's educational progress suffers as a result of poor mental health. Mental health
                            issues can have a negative impact
                            on a student's energy level, attentiveness, reliability, mental capacity, and optimism,
                            causing them to perform poorly. According to research, depression is
                            linked to poorer grade point averages, and co-occurring sadness and anxiety might amplify
                            this link. Depression has also been connected to school dropout <a href="#Refrences">[7]</a>.

                            mental illnesses directly impact physical health.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Mental health issues may come with physical symptoms. Since our bodies and minds are not
                            isolated, it is not unexpected that mental illness may affect your physical health. Poor
                            mental health can interfere with your ability to think clearly, make healthy decisions, and
                            fight off chronic diseases. Anxiety, for example, can cause an upset stomach, while
                            depression can cause headaches, fatigue, and digestive difficulties. Other symptoms may
                            include insomnia, restlessness, and difficulties focusing <a href="#Refrences">[9]</a>.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Furthermore, mental illness can alter the brain's structure and its chemical output <a href="#Refrences">[10]</a>.
                            Let's take the most common mental illness, depression, as an example and see how it affects
                            the brain in various ways.

                            Three parts of the brain that appear to play a role in major depressive disorder include the

                                        The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the cerebral cortex that covers the frontal lobe.
                                        This brain area has been linked to sophisticated cognitive behaviour planning,
                                        personality expression,
                                        decision making, and social behaviour regulating. This brain region's primary
                                        function is supposed to be the orchestration of thoughts and behaviours in line
                                        with internal goals.
                                        Executive function is the most common psychological term for functions performed
                                        by the prefrontal cortex region.
                                        Executive function refers to the capacity to distinguish between opposing
                                        concepts, decide good and bad, better and best,
                                        same and different, future repercussions of current activities, working toward a
                                        specific goal, prediction of results, expectation
                                        based on actions, and social "control" (the ability to suppress urges that, if
                                        not suppressed, could lead to socially unacceptable outcomes) <a href="#Refrences">[12]</a>.

                                        personalities as well as our ability to align our behaviour with our beliefs and

                            including <span style="color:#B80300;">brain shrinkage</span> and a <span

                                Cortisol is the brain's stress hormone. People suffering from major depressive disorder
                                produce more cortisol than the average person. Long-term exposure causes areas of the
                                brain to shrink, particularly the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, which are important
                                in memory and decision making <a href="#Refrences">[16]</a>. According to one study, women with a history of
                                depression had 9-13% smaller hippocampi than those who had never struggled with

                                People suffering from depression frequently have a more active amygdala than the normal
                                brain.
                                When exposed to negative stimuli such as a sad face, the amygdala in depressed persons
                                is more active than in non-depressed people.
                                When both participants are exposed to a positive stimulus, such as a joyful face, there
                                is minimal difference.
                                Researchers believe that elevated amounts of the stress hormone cortisol may be the
                                cause of this abnormality <a href="#Refrences">[18]</a>.
